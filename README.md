I wrote a system that allows the users phone system to interact with their Great Plains/CMS system. If they have an automated phone system capable of collecting account number (locationid) information and capable of sending that information to their CSR workstations when phone calls are presented to agents, the app will pop up the customerâ€™s  account screen based on the account number entered.
